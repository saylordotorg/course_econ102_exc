**Unit 3: Unemployment and Inflation** <span id="3"></span> 
*Most individuals probably understand the economic concepts of
unemployment and inflation. Unemployment reflects the number of people
out of work who are actively seeking work, and inflation indicates an
overall rise in the price level of most, but not all, goods and
services. This unit will give you a deeper look at these concepts, as
well as their interrelationship.  
    
 Consider first that inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar
– or any other monetary unit, like the euro, yen, or pound. By
distinguishing between nominal income, or the actual amount of money,
and real income, or the amount of goods and services it can buy,
macroeconomics helps measure the effects that inflation has on an
economy and on its constituents’ standards of living. Second, consider
some details about unemployment. There is the labor force, which
includes both the employed and unemployed, or those able and willing to
work but not currently working, and those not in the labor force,
including full time students, nonworking spouses, and retirees. Third,
adding another layer of evolving depth, this unit defines and describes
three types of unemployment: frictional unemployment (or temporary
unemployment); structural unemployment (affecting whole sectors of the
economy); and cyclical unemployment (caused by downturns in the
economy).  
    
 To better understand the interrelationship between unemployment and
inflation consider the following unlikely event. Suppose everyone who
was seeking a job got one tomorrow, began earning income, and spent
their income. As it would take longer for the products to arrive in
retail stores, there would be a lot of money chasing a few goods.
Consequently, unemployment would fall and the overall price level would
rise. Gaining further depth in the progression of this course, the
differences between our expectations for inflation and our observations
of it tend to reinforce the notion that expectations play a large role
in macroeconomics.*

*Note: The reading assigned below Subunit 3.2 covers this topic. Focus
on the text below the heading “Structural Unemployment” on pages 8-10.*
Structural unemployment*, which is the most severe of the three types,
typically requires workers to seek retraining or additional education as
a consequence of structural changes in the economy.*

**3.2.3 Cyclical Unemployment** <span id="3.2.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below Subunit 3.2 covers this topic. Focus
on the text below the heading “Cyclical Unemployment” on pages 10 and

**3.8 Macroeconomic Consequences of Inflation** <span id="3.8"></span> 
*Note: The “Inflation” reading assigned below Subunit 3.6 covers this
topic.*

**3.8.1 Uncertainty** <span id="3.8.1"></span> 
Uncertainty *is one of the immediate outcomes from inflation, as changes
in price level affect decisions about consumption or production more
difficult. Most economists tend to agree that the inflation rate on
average will hover around 3%, though the gap between the expected and
the actual rate of inflation can add to those uncertainties. Many labor
contracts use this figure for cost of living adjustments.*

**3.8.2 Speculation** <span id="3.8.2"></span> 
Speculation *occurs when individuals base their purchase decisions on
their expectations of inflation. If they think inflation will be higher
next year, they will purchase the item now before the item’s price goes
up. Keep in mind the prices of some items decline, while the inflation
rate or the level of prices in general increases.*

**3.8.3 Tax Bracket Creep** <span id="3.8.3"></span> 
Tax bracket creep *refers to the additional tax rates earners face as
their nominal or current incomes increase. Higher incomes often mean a
higher tax bracket. In 2012 in acting to prevent an increase in taxes
for most Americans, the US Congress gave some consideration to bracket
creep, possibly reflecting some concerns it may hold about the expected
rate of inflation for 2013.*

**3.8.4 Deflation Dangers** <span id="3.8.4"></span> 
Deflation danger *refers to the fact that deflation may be more
difficult to manage than inflation, as the experience of doing so in the
US is almost nonexistent. Deflation is the opposite of inflation and
means the general level of prices is decreasing. One can imagine how
deflation might affect labor contracts and the various consequences of
pay raises at a time when prices are falling.*

**3.9 Measurements of Inflation** <span id="3.9"></span> 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) *calculations are restricted to the
consumers’ purchasing behavior only in the context of price increases of
goods and services from one period of time to another. CPI does not take
into account the* producer price index*, or* PPI. *The PPI is a measure
of the average change over time in the selling prices received by
domestic producers for their output. An upside to having so many indices
to measure inflation is that each one (i.e., GDP deflator GDP price
index, CPI, and PPI) serves as a measure of the same inflationary
tendencies but measures it in a slightly different way.*

    basket of goods. As you prepare to cover various measures of
    inflation, keep in mind that the CPI captures the changes in prices
    of items consumers typically purchase from retail outlets. Some
    measures are broader in scope than others.

    Link: Wikipedia: [“Producer Price
    Index”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, which covers several aspects of
    the index, including its calculations and emphasis on the prices
    that producers typically pay for inputs like raw resources or
    intermediate goods from vendors and wholesale outlets. Keep in mind
    that some measures of inflation are broader than others.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

    Link: Wikipedia: [“GDP
    Deflator”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_deflator) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, which covers several aspects of
    the GDP deflator, including its calculations. As the deflator covers
    the components of GDP, it is the broadest among several measures of
    inflation. Comparisons of the deflator against the PPI and the CPI
    can reveal information about the sources of inflation. As this
    course progressively builds on the material presented, you will find
    more on this topic in Subunit 3.11.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

**3.12 Protective Mechanisms: Adjustments for Inflation** <span
id="3.12"></span> 
*The two subunits in this section draw from information gathered in
Subunit 3.11, as the adjustments below are mechanisms designed to offset
the two types of inflation.*

**3.12.1 Cost of Living Adjustments** <span id="3.12.1"></span> 
*As mentioned in Subunit 3.8.1, one of the mechanisms used to keep
current incomes close to real incomes is to build into contracts an
adjustment that tracks with the expected inflation rate. Social security
benefit administrators, landlords, and others pay attention to inflation
rates and seek to maintain their real level of income.*

**3.12.2 Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs)** <span id="3.12.2"></span> 
ARMs *take into account the inflation rate, as it can affect nominal or
current interest rates and represent an attempt to maintain the real
interest rate over time. In the instance of ARMs, the real interest rate
is the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate.*
