**Unit 4: Aggregate Economic Activities and Fluctuations** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In studying macroeconomics, the focal point is the whole economy versus
markets for goods and services. This approach entails looking at the
forces affecting growth, inflation, and unemployment at the aggregate
level whether it is output, income, or the set of components within GDP.
In essence, macroeconomics involves studying demand and supply for all
goods and services in a nation’s economy. Aggregate demand is the total
amount of goods and services people want to buy; in other words, it
measures what people wish to purchase rather than what is actually
produced. The aggregate demand is the sum of consumption, investment,
government expenses, and net exports. Aggregate supply is the total
output an economy produces at a given price level. As you learned in
microeconomics, firms achieve equilibrium when they produce the quantity
of goods and services consumers want to buy *– *that is, when aggregate
supply equals aggregate demand. This unit will examine shifts in
aggregate supply and aggregate demand and their short-term and long-term
effects for the whole economy.*

Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   graphically represent and interpret a short-run aggregate supply
    curve, and explain why it slopes upward and factors leading to its
    shift outward or inward;
-   define *aggregate demand*, and identify the reasons for its negative
    slope;
-   explain the factors leading to a shift in the consumption function;
-   define *short-run equilibrium* and *long-run equilibrium*, and
    discuss how they differ;
-   describe the four phases of a business cycle, including references
    to income and real output;
-   graphically represent and interpret a long-run aggregate supply
    curve, and explain its connection to natural level of unemployment;
    and
-   describe how short-run equilibriums occur above and below the output
    level associated with the natural rate of unemployment

**4.1.2.3 Occasional Need for Government Intervention** <span
id="4.1.2.3"></span> 
*Many consider the federal government to be a lender of last resort. The
Great Depression is partly the consequence of many factors including,
but not limited to, common thinking in the 1920s that government has no
role in managing the economy, the absence of a division of the economy
into microeconomics and macroeconomics, and the lack of awareness that
equilibrium can occur alongside unemployment and business cycles.*

**4.2 The Macroeconomic Model** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Models are tools by which we simplify reality. They consist of
variables that are related by theory, which means a change in one set of
factors leads to a subsequent change in other factors. The first set is
sometimes referred to as determinants, and the second set is referred to
as outcomes. Subunits 4.2.1 through 4.2.2.5 provide details about these
factors.*

**4.2.2.2 Jobs** <span id="4.2.2.2"></span> 
*As a brief refresher, three major macroeconomic goals are price
stability, economic growth, and full employment. Some primary and
interrelated outcomes from the goal-based macroeconomic model are
outputs and jobs. Those two outcomes that represent employment as
resources such as labor, land, and capital are employed in producing
outputs. In essence, workers produce outputs, their work generates
income, and their income is spent on the outputs from the work of
others. The association between outputs and incomes, in part, influences
both the prices of goods and services and the price level.*

    Cycles”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this section and attempt the “Try It” exercises.
    This material will provide you with a general understanding of how
    the present financial crisis can be contextualized by studying
    macroeconomics, which is the analysis of aggregate values of
    economic variables. Keep in mind that economic growth is partly a
    function of the extent to which there are employments of land,
    labor, and capital. Issues such as worker productivity,
    technological state, and public policy influence economic growth.
    Economic growth is evident in the rise in real GDP over time, for
    example, when the peaks in business cycle become higher and higher
    and the outward movement of the production possibilities curve. Keep
    in mind that there are many ways to measure economic growth.  
        
     Reading this section and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 1 hour.

**4.3.1 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Curves** <span
id="4.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The “Aggregate Demand” video lecture assigned below Subunit 4.3
covers this topic. Please pay special attention to the components that
constitute aggregate demand and the factors that affect each of these
components, resulting in shifts of the AD curve. These lecture notes
also explain why the AD curve is negatively-sloped. If you have studied
microeconomics, you may remember that the reason for the negative slope
of the AD curve is different than what it was for the individual/market
demand curve. For Aggregate Supply (AS), please be aware of the
distinction between the Short-Run AS curve and the Long-Run AS curve and
the factors that lead to shifts or changes in the two curves,
respectively. Finally, look at how the AD and the AS interact to reach
equilibrium.*

**4.3.1.1 Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve** <span
id="4.3.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The “Aggregate Demand” video lecture assigned below Subunit 4.3
covers this topic. The aggregate demand curve slopes downward due to the
price level and consumption (i.e., the wealth effect), the price level
and investment (i.e., the interest rate effect), and the price level and
net exports (i.e., the exchange rate effect).*

**4.3.1.2 Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve** <span
id="4.3.1.2"></span> 
Note: The “Aggregate Demand” lecture assigned below Subunit 4.3 covers
this topic. There are numerous factors that affect the quantity of goods
and services demanded at a given price level. When a factor changes, the
aggregate demand curve shifts left or right.

**4.3.2 Macroeconomic Equilibrium** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
Macroeconomic equilibrium *is determined when a country’s data indicates
that its GDP is equal to its aggregate expenditures and when its savings
is equal to its investments. Adjustments toward equilibrium occur when a
country’s consumption equals its investments and its savings equals its
investments. Consequently, the country has zero unplanned changes in
inventory and its GDP equals its aggregate expenditure.*

**4.3.3 Macroeconomic Failures** <span id="4.3.3"></span> 
*Macroeconomic equilibrium may or may not reflect attainment of the
three basic macroeconomic goals. A gap is likely to exist between the
actual GDP and the full employment or potential GDP, which can mean that
employment can be too low or too high. The former refers to
unemployment, and the latter refers to inflation; both are undesirable
and often lead to instability arising from actions that attempt to
address the gap.*

    Link: YouTube: Khan Academy’s [“Long-Run Aggregate
    Supply”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDQUKpnMgf8) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this lecture about long-run aggregate supply.
    The short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward due to the lag
    between product prices and resource prices that makes it profitable
    for firms to increase output when the price level rises. The
    long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical when a country is at
    full employment. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical
    because, in the long run, resource prices adjust to changes at the
    price level, which leaves no incentive for firms to change their
    output. In the long run, prices and wages have no effect on the
    aggregate supply curve.

**4.6 Four Components of Aggregate Demand** <span id="4.6"></span> 
**4.6.1 Consumption Function** <span id="4.6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Principles of Macroeconomics: “Chapter 13: Consumption
    and the Aggregate Expenditures Model”**
    Link: *Principles of Macroeconomics*: [“Chapter 13: Consumption and
    the Aggregate Expenditures
    Model”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf#page=473) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this chapter, and attempt the “Try It”
    exercises. This chapter will show you how the aggregate demand curve
    can be derived from the aggregate expenditures model. Note that
    aggregate expenditures relate to the summation of planned levels of
    spending by consumers, businesses, government agencies, and global
    trade partners at a given price level. Notice also how the slope of
    the aggregate expenditures curve relates to the multiplier. This
    chapter will also cover subunits 4.6.2 through 4.6.4.  
        
     Reading this chapter and attempting the exercises should take
    approximately 4 hours.

-   **Reading: Wikipedia: “Output Gap”**
    Link: Wikipedia: [“Output
    Gap”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_gap) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, focusing your attention on the two
    types of GDP: full employment and equilibrium. You should be able to
    draw distinctions between these two types after reading this
    article. Full employment GDP occurs near what this reading refers to
    as *potential* GDP – where the long-run aggregate supply curve is
    vertical. In contrast, equilibrium GDP occurs where the short-run
    aggregate supply curve intersects the aggregate demand curve. Output
    gaps occur when the three curves intersect at different points. This
    reading covers the topics outlined in subunits 4.7.1 and 4.7.2,
    which draw attention to two basic types of output gaps.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

**4.7.1 Recessionary Gap** <span id="4.7.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below subunit 4.7 covers this topic. The
recessionary gap occurs to the left of long-run equilibrium in a graph
depicting the aggregate demand, short-run aggregate supply, and long-run
aggregate supply curves. In short, it means the business cycle is in a
contractionary phase with high unemployment, low output, and low income
levels.*

**4.7.2 Inflationary Gap** <span id="4.7.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below subunit 4.7 covers this topic. The
inflationary gap occurs to the right of long-run equilibrium in a graph
depicting the aggregate demand, short-run aggregate supply, and long-run
aggregate supply curves. In short, it means the business cycle is in a
contractionary phase with high unemployment, low output, and low income
levels.*

     Instructions: Read this section. Unlike the other two indicators,
    this indicator provides an estimate of the state of the economy
    after the fact. For instance, the unemployment rate, as a lagging
    indicator, will decrease (increase) after an economic expansion
    (contraction) already began. In this reading, you will observe the
    set of variables for this indicator, and you should be able to draw
