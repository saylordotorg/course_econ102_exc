title: "ECON102-EXC: Principles of Macroeconomics"
course_description: "An exploration of the factors that impact the overall performance of economies. The course focuses on public policies helping and hindering the achievement of intended outcomes, such as reducing unemployment or increasing trade. ECON102-EXC is aligned with a challenge exam proctored by Excelsior College, a private, nonprofit institution with a credit-by-exam program that enables students to earn college level credit in select subject areas by passing proficiency examinations."

**Unit 2: Macroeconomics: Goals, Measures, and Challenges** <span
id="2"></span> 
*A major focal point of macroeconomics is the total output generated
within an economy. Measurement of that output includes* Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), *which is the dollar value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation’s borders during the course of one
year. Macroeconomics also focuses on the difference between nominal GDP
and real GDP. The latter version removes the effect of inflation, which
increases its importance as a useful measure because total output might
be increasing in terms of current dollars but not in constant dollars.  
    
 Economic growth, which is the increase in real GDP over time, is one of
three major goals. The other two goals are full employment and price
level stability. Fiscal and monetary policies, which are introduced in
Unit 5, are formed, implemented, and evaluated against those three
goals. You will likely find that macroeconomics focuses on what should
be done to achieve those goals as opposed to what is done. Accordingly,
this unit and those that follow will uncover scenarios and philosophical
debates about the role of government in a market-based economy and
whether the GDP is an accurate measure of societal well-being, quality
of life, and the standard of living.*

**2.1 Rationale for GDP: A Monetary Measure** <span id="2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Principles of Macroeconomics*: “Chapter 6: Measuring
    Total Output and Income”**
    Link: *Principles of Macroeconomics*: [“Chapter 6: Measuring Total
    Output and
    Income”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 6, which is about measuring domestic
    output, and attempt the “Try It” exercises. This material
    concentrates on the purpose and function of GDP. More importantly,
    this reading will help you prepare for the deeper, detailed
    approaches that receive coverage in subunits 2.2 through 2.5.  
        
     Reading this chapter and attempting the exercises should take
    approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes.

**2.2 Avoidance of Double Counting** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below Subunit 2.1 covers this topic. Focus
on the description of double counting below the section titled “Final
Goods and Value Added” on pages 19 and 20. It is important to keep in
mind that final goods and services are finished products that are
produced in a given year. For example, a fully manufactured automobile
is a final good. The products that are used to manufacture final goods
are called* intermediate parts *or* inputs *and are not counted; all of
the resources or inputs that are used to manufacture an automobile are
only counted as one completed product. If the intermediate parts are
counted as well as the final good, it is known as *double
counting; *this can diminish the accuracy of the GDP measurement.*

**2.3 Calculating GDP: Expenditure and Income Approaches** <span
id="2.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below Subunit 2.1 covers this topic. It is
important to keep in mind that this section details the computational
method for calculating total output in the economy using income. Income
is the other side of the national income accounting process. For a
country (or household) to be efficient, it must be able to detail the
sources of its income. The point of the national income accounting
system is to determine efficiency of a country, much like one would do
in one’s own household. Economists seek data about income as well as
expenditure; ideally, the two should be in balance *–* that is, they
should be the same amount. When income and expenditure are balanced, the
country or the household is said to have a balanced budget.*

     Instructions: Read the information on Gross National Product and
    Gross Domestic Product on pages 1 and 2. *Gross Domestic Product*
    refers to production counted within a country’s borders, whereas
    *Gross National Product* refers to production by domestic factors
    both inside and outside of a country’s borders. In modern times, the
    Group of Seven (G7), Group of Eight (G8), and the Group of 20 (G20)
    use the GDP formula in measuring GDP growth, so the global economy
    uses the same formula to measure each country’s economic welfare or
    well-being. This ensures that countries are on the same accounting
    page. Note that some countries use GNP as a metric, but GDP is the
    standard accounting system.

**2.5 Problems Using GDP as a Measure of Well-Being** <span
id="2.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned below Subunit 2.1 covers this topic. Focus
on Section 6.3, titled “GDP and Economic Well-Being.” Keep the
limitations of GDP statistics in mind. Because GDP exclusively measures
the expenditures and income of a country, the measurement of that
country’s economic welfare does not always take into account all of the
components of the country’s well-being. There are several criticisms
regarding using GDP as a measure of economic well-being. Some of the
criticisms are that the GDP does not take into account non-market
activities, leisure time, product quality, the underground economy, the
environment, the composition and distribution of output, or any
non-economic sources of well-being.*
