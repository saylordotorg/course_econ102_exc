**Unit 7: International Trade** <span id="7"></span> 
*Trade among countries serves many functions aside from the exchange of
goods and services at a global level. For instance, trade facilitates
movements of foreign currencies held in a country’s bank because imports
are paid in the unit of the exporting country's currency. Additionally,
trading partners have more and a greater variety of goods available to
them. In short, those gains from trade arise out of comparative
advantage, specialization, and export activities. However, international
trade can become and often is an emotionally or politically charged
issue that cuts across microeconomics and macroeconomics; it is probably
a good time now to recall the difference between them. Nonetheless, most
of the content within this unit centers on the topic from an economic
perspective and directs attention to factors such as trade balances,
exchange rates, and other aspects of a country’s macroeconomic
performance.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   compare and contrast and discuss absolute advantage and comparative

-   identify tariffs and quotas in international trade and how they
    relate to net exports;

    international trade; and
