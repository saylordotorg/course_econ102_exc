**Unit 6: Monetary Policy and Various Complexities behind Macroeconomic
Policies** <span id="6"></span> 
*Fiscal policy and monetary policy are the two main tools by which
government attempts to steer the macroeconomy toward the three main
goals and economic growth. Monetary policy consists of methods through
which the Federal Reserve attempts to engage banks, businesses, and
individuals in effecting changes to interest rates, the supply of money,
the demand for money, and so forth. Money serves as a medium of
exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Those three functions
enable individuals to avoid bartering. The ways in which we define and
measure money are important to managing an economy. Savings and
investment are key elements within the circular flow model and are a
function of interest rates.*

    banking. Be mindful that *total reserves* are the checkable deposits
    that the public has placed in a commercial bank. *Required reserves*
    are a percentage of the checkable deposits that must remain in a
    commercial bank as required by the Federal Reserve. Required
    reserves are set by the Federal Reserve to protect banks from
    customers running on the bank, i.e., reserves protects a bank from
    customer panic. *Excess reserves* are a percentage of checkable
    deposits that a bank is authorized by the Federal Bank to lend
    out. Consequently, required reserves are deposits from which the
    banks earn a profit through the loan and repayment process.

money supply. Typically, the required reserve ratio is between 1 and 3
percent; it may even increase to 10 percent based on the Federal
Reserve’s desire to minimize recessionary or inflationary gaps.*

**6.5 The Money Market** <span id="6.5"></span> 
*Graphical representations of money markets are visualizations of a
combination of an economy’s transactional demands plus an economy’s
asset demands. By way of introduction to this subunit, individuals and
organizations face choices regarding what they can do with their money.
In terms of spending as it relates to what is known as the money market,
individuals and organizations can buy stocks, bonds, imports, foreign
currencies, goods and services, and so forth.*

**6.5.1 The Demand for Money** <span id="6.5.1"></span> 
*One interpretation of the money demand curve is based on an economy’s
interest rate. This interpretation rests on the position of the supply
of money and the interest rates on money. Regarding shifting factors,
the money supply can increase based on lower interest rates or decrease
based on higher interest rates.*

**6.5.2 Equilibrium Interest Rates** <span id="6.5.2"></span>

     Instructions: Watch this lecture, which discusses interest as rent
    for money. Be mindful that equilibrium interest rates are the
    balance or combination of the market for money plus the investment
    demand for money. Consequently, equilibrium real GDP and the price
    level will determine the equilibrium based on transactional demand
    and investment demand.

    Exchange”](http://ingrimayne.com/econ/Financial/ForeignExchange.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article about the exchange of currencies.
    Exchange rates relate the price of a country’s own currency compared
    to the price of another country’s currency mainly for the purpose of
    international trade. Trading partners need to convert their own
    currency into that of the country from which imports originate. For
    example, when the United States imports vehicles from Japan, the
    United States pays for them in Yen and needs to purchase that
    currency using US Dollars. In essence, the demand for and supply of
    currencies determine the exchange rate. After reading the article,

    Markets”](http://ingrimayne.com/econ/Financial/Speculators.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article about the stock market and how
    expectations play a role in terms of changes in the price of a
    stock. Speculators tend to focus on changes in prices and attempt to
    sell at a price higher than they bought the stock. You will learn
    that a stock is a share of ownership in an organization, and its
    price is determined largely by the supply of and the demand for
    stocks in the stock market. After reading the article, click on the

     Instructions: Read this article about bonds and some factors
    related to their prices. Like stocks, an objective is to sell at a
    higher price than that at time of purchase. Part of this effort
    entails focusing on current and anticipated interest rates. Unlike
    stocks, bonds take the form of loans. You will learn about a
    specific relationship that exists between bond prices and interest
    rates. After reading the article, click on the “Review” tab to

**6.6 Issues with Monetary Policy** <span id="6.6"></span> 
**6.6.1 Time Orientations** <span id="6.6.1"></span> 
*This subunit refers to the recognition lag, the decision lag, and the
implementation lag. You need to place each one of these lags in a
timeframe and gain information about the complexity of policy-related
actions or inaction. Keep in mind that some economists contend that
monetary policy takes effect faster than fiscal policy, which is
essentially the product of Congressional legislation. However, debates
linger about which policy is the most effective at any given time.*

**6.8.2 The Phillips Curve** <span id="6.8.2"></span>

    Long
    Run”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read these sections about the Phillips curve, a
    short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. The Phillips
    curve demonstrates that there is a trade-off between inflation and
    unemployment. According to the curve, when inflation is higher than
    expected, people will work at a lower real wage. Employers will in
    turn hire more workers at the lower real wage, increasing output and
    reducing unemployment. In the 1970s and 1980s, when both inflation
    and unemployment were continually rising – a phenomenon known as
    *stagflation *– many economists questioned the soundness of the
    Phillips curve. Attempt the “Try It” exercises at the end of each
    section.  
        
     Reading these sections and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.
