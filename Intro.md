Course Syllabus for "ECON102-EXC: Principles of Macroeconomics"
---------------------------------------------------------------

Economics is traditionally divided into two parts: microeconomics and
macroeconomics. The main purpose of this course is to introduce you to
the principles of macroeconomics. *Macroeconomics* is the study of how a
country’s economy works while trying to discern among good, better, and
best choices for improving and/or maintaining a nation’s standard of
living and level of economic and societal well-being. Historical and
contemporary perspectives on the roles and policies of government are
part of the mix of interpretations and alternatives that surround
questions of who or what gains and loses the most or least within a
relatively small set of key interdependent players. In the broadest
view, that set consists of households, consumers, savers, firm owners,
investors, agency and elected officials, and global trading partners in
which some wear many hats and face price considerations at two levels.
Consider one distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics
though prices are taken into account in both divisions. On one hand,
microeconomics focuses on how supply and demand within a given market
determine prices. On the other hand, macroeconomics focuses on changes
in the price level across all markets. Another distinction resides
within goals. A study of microeconomics orients itself toward firm
profit maximization and output optimization as well as consumer utility
maximization and consumption optimization. In contrast, a study of
macroeconomics situates itself around a number of goals including
economic growth, price stability, and full employment. Macroeconomic
performance relies on measures of economic activity, focusing on
variables and data at the national level within a specific period of
time. Macroeconomics entails analyses of aggregate measures such as
national income, national output, unemployment and inflation rates, and
business cycle fluctuations. This course will prompt you to think
critically about the national and global issues we currently face, to
consider competing views that may agree or disagree with your own, and
to draw challenging conclusions from a vast array of perspectives,
tools, and alternatives. This course is designed to align with Excelsior
College’s Macroeconomics examination. Visit the [Excelsior

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

    and describe the relationship between inflation and unemployment;

    full employment, and other goals;
-   describe the mechanics of money supply in detail (i.e.,
    specifically, identify different types of money; articulate the

    money, the money multiplier, and the process of interest rate
    determination; and discuss the role of the Federal Reserve System

**Requirements for Completion:** To complete this course, you will need
to study the information in each unit. You will gain knowledge and
reinforcement of course concepts by completing the assessments that
accompany the assigned reading material. Careful attention to Unit 1 is
important, because it establishes a foundation upon which to build your
knowledge and expertise. You will need to complete the following:  

-   Unit 1 Assessment
-   Unit 2 Assessment
-   Unit 3 Assessment
-   Unit 5 Assessment
-   Unit 6 Assessment
-   Unit 7 Assessment
-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam for
the Saylor Foundation. However, in order to adequately prepare for this
exam, you will need to work through all of the materials in each unit
and the assessments listed above.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
Saylor’s final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 Once you have completed this course and feel comfortable with the
course material, you may take the UExcel Introduction to Macroeconomics
Exam. You must register for the exam in advance. For more information
about the exam, please visit Excelsior College’s [Credit by
Exam](http://www.excelsior.edu/ecapps/exams/examDetail.jsf) webpage.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **141.25
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you to plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look
at these time advisories, to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 17.25 hours. Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 8.75 hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights; subunit 1.2 (a total
of 8.5 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** This course uses a variety of tools to explain
how the economy works. Pay close attention to the definitions of key
words and take note of how they are used in an economic context. Graphs
and charts explain trends and present complex sets of information in a
visual format. Math is used to develop models, measure the effect of
policies, and help make decisions. This combination of words, graphs,
and math to explain the same concept can make economics a challenging
area of study. As you work through the course, think about how you
perceive the information and other possible ways to explain ideas.
