**Unit 1: Overview of Economics** <span id="1"></span> 
*A study of economics usually begins by dividing the subject into
microeconomics and macroeconomics. The former focuses on the exchanges
between consumers and firms in markets for goods and services. In
contrast, the latter focuses on exchanges that occur across all markets
within a country, taking into account the interrelated actions of
consumers, businesses, government agencies, financial intermediaries,
and global trading partners as they exchange resources, goods, and
services as well as facilitate currency and quantity flows. Furthermore,
microeconomics concerns itself narrowly with the profit maximization
goal, and macroeconomics addresses what should be done to achieve a
greater, broader set of goals. Moreover, a feature common to a
successful study of economics is your ability to distinguish changes
that occur moving along a curve versus those that occur shifting a curve
outward or inward.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   identify the determinants of demand and supply;
-   describe how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in a
    market’s equilibrium price and quantity;

    markets for goods and resources as well as the exchanges between
    businesses and households.

**1.1 Basic Introduction to Marketplace Economics** <span

-   **Reading: *Principles of Macroeconomics*: “Chapter 3: Demand and
    Supply” and “Chapter 4: Applications of Demand and Supply”**
    Link: *Principles of Macroeconomics*: [“Chapter 3: Demand and
    Supply”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf) (PDF) and [“Chapter
    4: Applications of Demand and
    Supply”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, and attempt the “Try
    It” exercises. These chapters will help you gain familiarity and
    competencies with regard to basic demand and supply concepts. At a
    minimum, you should be able to list the factors that shift the
    demand curve and those that shift the supply curve after completing
    these chapters. This will help you prepare for similar types of
    analyses in the units ahead.  
        
     Reading these chapters and attempting the exercises should take
    approximately 8 hours.

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3, focusing your attention on the
    consequences of changes in demand and supply. At a minimum, you will
    be expected to discern whether the change in any given factor will
    affect supply or demand and the direction of that effect. In
    essence, it is important to begin thinking now about the forces that
    lead to changes in equilibrium whether they occur at the market
    level or across markets.  
        
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 45 minutes.
