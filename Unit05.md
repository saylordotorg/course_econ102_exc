**Unit 5: Fiscal Policy** <span id="5"></span> 
*Using various policies and tools, a government attempts to steer the
macroeconomy toward three main goals: full employment, price stability,
and economic growth. The remaining units in the course will cover
conflicts and complexities in relation to those policies and tools. This
unit will focus on fiscal policy, which consists of taxing and spending,
usually done through acts involving Congress or comparable legislative
bodies.*

     Instructions: Read this section to learn about how the government’s
    fiscal actions influence aggregate demand. This section first
    discusses automatic stabilizers and how they function. It then
    covers discretionary fiscal policy, which are changes in aggregate
    demand resulting from changes in government purchases, income taxes,
    and transfer payments. Attempt the “Try It” exercises at the end of
    the section.  
        
     Reading this section and attempting the exercises should take
    approximately 1 hour.

**5.1.1.1 Government Spending Multiplier** <span id="5.1.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The John Petroff reading assigned below subunit 5.1 briefly
covers this topic. Focus on the “Government Spending Increase” section
on page 1. The* government spending multiplier *is a tool used to
manipulate the economy and mitigate inflation or recession that goes
beyond the ordinary uses of taxes. In this process, the government
spending multiplier deploys additional monies or restricts monies to
assist in economic stability.*

**5.1.1.2 Tax Multiplier** <span id="5.1.1.2"></span> 
*Note: The John Petroff reading assigned below subunit 5.1 briefly
covers this topic. Focus on the “Tax Increase” section on page 1. The*
tax multiplier *is a tool used to manipulate the economy and mitigate
inflation or recession that goes beyond the ordinary uses of taxes. In
this process, the tax multiplier uses the manipulation of taxes, which
is known as* fiscal policy.

**5.1.1.3 Balanced Budget Multiplier** <span id="5.1.1.3"></span> 
*Note: The John Petroff reading assigned below subunit 5.1 briefly
covers this topic. Focus on the “Balanced Budget Multiplier” section on
page 2. The* balanced budget multiplier *operates within the context of
aggressively reducing a deficit by collecting more taxes to enable the
government’s revenue to match its expenses.*

     Instructions: Read this article, which explains the crowding out
    process in the economy. Some economists contend that, as the largest
    borrower, the government’s borrowing increases interest rates. By
    extension, those increases displace or crowd out business
    investment.

    involved with the use of macroeconomic policy. Among them are the

**5.1.3.1 Discretionary Actions** <span id="5.1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The lecture assigned below Subunit 5.1.3 briefly covers this
topic.* Discretionary fiscal policy *is how the executive and
legislative branches exercise their choice of increasing or decreasing
taxes or spending to attain economic stability.*

*Note: The lecture assigned below Subunit 5.1.3 briefly covers this
topic.* Automatic stabilizers *are the non-discretionary occurrences
that mitigate fluctuations in GDP. When that happens, the government
automatically gains increases in revenues as a consequence of economic
expansions.*

     Instructions: Read this article, which covers several aspects of
    how the national debt in the US grew including the major
    contributions that stem from spending on wars and issues related to

    Debt”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, focusing your attention on the
    “Implicit Debt” section. Among the interpretations to be gleaned
    from this reading are the facts that government can be the largest
    borrower, which drives interest rates higher than otherwise; other
    borrowers become reluctant to seek loans; and future generations
    inherit the debt without clarity regarding the associated benefits.
    You can probably come up with some interpretations on your own
    accord.

    Debt”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_debt) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, which covers several aspects about
    who outside of a country owns the nation’s debt. Entities outside a
    country lend money to a government or other entity within a country.
    As debt is handled, principal and interest is paid and sometimes
    debts are forgiven or eliminated.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.
